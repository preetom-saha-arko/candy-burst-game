Drag a candy to swap it. Just click, drag and then release. 
REMEMBER, you can't swap a candy diagonally or overtaking another candy.

Try to match 3/4/5 candies in a row or column (by swapping) to gain points. You will get 10 points for each candy.

Bonus points will be rewarded for matching 4 or 5 candies in a single column or row.

Think fast!! Try to score as much as possible in the given two minutes.

Good luck...
